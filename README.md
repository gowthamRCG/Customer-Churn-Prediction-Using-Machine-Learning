# Customer-Churn-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
Built an end-to-end customer churn prediction system using the Telco dataset. Performed data preprocessing, handled class imbalance with SMOTE, trained a Random Forest model, evaluated performance using ROC-AUC and F1-score, and deployed the model to predict churn on unseen customer data.
